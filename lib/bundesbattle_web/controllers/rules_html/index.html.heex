    <div class="py-8">
      <h2 class="mb-4 text-2xl font-stencil text-brand">General Tournament Rules</h2>
      <ul class="pl-6 space-y-4 list-disc">
        <li>All tournaments are held in a double-elimination style bracket.</li>
        <li>
          Controllers may not send simultaneous opposite cardinal directions (SOCD), such as Left+Right or Up+Down. This is typically enforced by cleaning firmware. Standard stock gamepads (e.g., PlayStation DUALSHOCKÂ®4) are exempt from this rule.
        </li>
        <li>
          Coaching is limited to one coach per set for a maximum of one minute between matches. Violating this rule may result in a warning, followed by disqualification on a second offense.
        </li>
        <li>Contestants may request a blind pick prior to the start of a match.</li>
        <li>Contestants may play "rock paper scissors" to decide which side to play on.</li>
        <li>Only the player who lost the previous game is allowed to switch characters.</li>
        <li>
          Newly released characters are banned from tournament play for two weeks following their official release date.

    <%!-- Leaderboard Tiebreakers --%>
    <div class="py-8">
      <h2 class="mb-4 text-2xl font-stencil text-brand">Leaderboard Tiebreakers</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        The placements on a leaderboard are determined as follows:
      </p>
      <ol class="pl-6 space-y-4 list-decimal">
        <li>
          The total points from the player's 4 best placements. If a player participated in all 5 qualifiers of a region, their worst placement is discarded.
        </li>
        <li>
          If players are tied in points and both participated in all 5 qualifiers, the player with the better result in the 5th qualifier is ranked higher.
        </li>
        <li>
          If players are still tied, or if one or both players participated in fewer than 5 qualifiers, the player who earned their points in fewer events is ranked higher. (For players with 5 events, the discarded worst result is not counted here).
        </li>
        <li>
          If a tie persists, the player with the single best placement in any of the region's qualifiers is ranked higher.
        </li>
        <li>
          If still tied, the player with the better head-to-head record against the other tied players across all regional qualifiers is ranked higher.
        </li>
        <li>
          If players remain tied, they must play a Best-of-5 tiebreaker set. This is preferably played offline, but can be arranged online if necessary. The winner receives the higher placement.
        </li>
      </ol>

        Finals Eligibility for Direct Qualifier Winners
      </h2>
      <ul class="pl-6 space-y-4 list-disc">
        <li>
          Only players who are Swiss residents OR have participated in at least 3 qualifier events (including local and direct qualifiers) across all regions are eligible for direct qualifier spots.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a non-eligible player wins a direct qualifier, the spot is given to the next-best placing player who meets the criteria.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the first eligible players from a direct qualifier are tied in placement, the spot is given to the player with the highest total points across all combined regional leaderboards at the end of the season.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the same player wins both direct qualifier spots, the second spot is given to the 2nd place finisher of the direct qualifier tournament that had more participants.
